# rename-module-meanjs
Since the generator of crud module is kind of broken from yo with the 0.4.* version on meanjs, we can just keep the articles module example and transform it in what we want!

## Usage
Go to your root folder of your meanjs app, execute the script with ```sh rename-module.sh <NewModule>```.

That's it!
